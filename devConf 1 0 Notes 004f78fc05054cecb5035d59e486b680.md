    ### About
    
    Working as the Lead Product Manager at WeDevs. Where developers are focused on code, architecture, performance, and engineering, I would focus on the big picture of "what are we trying to do" and on the details of the user experience, the feature set, and the way the product will get used. It is almost impossible to document a complete list of the responsibilities that I maintain. Ex Product Manager at Poptin & Premio.

    ### **Tips and Tricks:**
    
    - reduce unnecessary meetings to save time
    - This could have been a long message/email
    - Amazon tricks for meeting
        
        For starters, whoever leads a meeting at Amazon has to write a document usually about sis pages long, to pass out at the start of it. Then everybody spends about 20 to 30 minutes silently reading and digesting what’s on that document, before going over the entire thing together, page by page.      
        
        Also: There’s no PowerPoint.Ever.
        
    - Don’t call a meeting without meeting agenda
    - Maintain great communication
    - communicate if you are stuck.
    - No social media/news/email checking in the earlier part of the day.
    - learn keyboard shortcuts
    - Health Hacks
        - Use good chair with black support. Buy a lumber roll.
        - Wear blue light protected glasses(and turn on the Night Mode on screen)
        - after every 25-30 min work, walk 5min

- ****M. Mahbubur Rahman ( CTO ⇒ iViveLabs & Technical Co-founder ⇒ [Tutoriaa](https://tutoriaa.com/)) (Session Topic : Entrepreneurship)**(Time: 9 min → 30 min)
    
    ### About
    
    Assalamu Alaikum, I would like to call myself a solution architect. It's been 25 years since I started coding, precisely in 1998. Having a hands on experience with a wide range of tools, I still enjoy coding in php, laravel, vue, react. Currently working as CTO in my founded company iViveLabs and also Technical Co-founder of an EdTech company called Tutoriaa.
    
    ### **Notes:**
    
    **Books:** The Lean Startup
    
    **Inspired idea Example:**
    
    - Pathao ⇒ Go-jek
    - Deligram ⇒ Bukalapak
    - Redmart ⇒ Chaldal
    - Freshdesk ⇒ Zendesk
    
    ### **For Start up**
    
    - **Smallest Product Marginal Cost**
    - **Have Clients try your product with zero setup.** (Give your product(software) to customer for try to use free first time.)
    - **Preset data in your software.** ( আপনার Demo Software এ আগে থেকে কিছু Data থাকা প্রয়োজন। যাতে করে Customer Essay তে সেটা Try করে দেখতে পারে। Customer কে যেন নিজে থেকে Entry দিয়ে Setup করতে না হয় সেটা মাথায় রাখতে হবে।)
    - **First mover’s Advantage, Follower’s advantage** (এইখানে বুঝানো হয়েছে আমরা যখন একটা product তৈরি করার plan করব তখন এই product টা আগে কেউ তৈরি করেছে কিনা সেটা দেখতে হবে। তৈরি করলে তাদের কি কি সমস্যা হয়েছিল তা আমরা জানতে পারব। এতে করে আমাদের আর এই সমস্যাগুলোতে পড়তে হবে না। কারণ আমরা এই সমস্যা আগে থেকেই জেনে গিয়েছি।)
    
    ### **So, how do we start?**
    
    - Find products/services which are already working.
    - Start with a niche, convince why your solution is better(not necessarily cheaper) (ছোট কিছু দিয়ে শুরু করা উচিত, এবং মানুষকে বুঝানো উচিত আপনারটা কেন ভাল।)
    - Grow the niche.
    - Keep adding value.
    - Listen to Customers.
    - Expand in other regions.
    
    ### **What not to do!**
    
    - Choosing a product that is inherently complex. e.g Video Streaming
    - Competitors are hostile. (যেই Company গুলোর Syndicate আছে তাদের মত Product নিয়ে First Time Start না করা।)
    - Competitors have an oligopoly(Pepsi, Coke)
    - Marginal profit is very minimal, you have to sell volume.

    **There are three problem to find job in Others country:**
    
    - lack of confidence.
    - communication.
    - world cultural adoptability .
    
    **We need** **Personal Development**(**Process of improving yourself through conscious habits and activities**.). **Five pillars** of Personal Development:
    
    - Personal Skills(Just because you are not born with it, does mean you cannot master it.)
        
        নিজের Personal Skill গুলোকে Develop করতে হবে, কারো সাথে কিভাবে পরিচিত হব সেটা শিখতে হবে, কিভাবে কথা বলব, Confidence Level বাড়াতে হবে।
        
    - Personal Growth(Get out of your comfort zone. Master the art of networking.)
        
        নিজের পরিচয় দেওয়ার সময় নিজের কাজ গুলোকে, নিজের Passion টাকে তুলে ধরতে হবে। Ex: I am XYZ. I am a Programmer/Web Developer. I was work many IT company. Here I was work many Web Project. There are ….. .
        
    - Personal Empowerment(Consistency, Discipline and Power of Prioritizing.)
        
        আমাদের প্রতিদিন অনেক কাজ করতে হয়। অনেক নতুন কাজ আসে। তবে আমাকে দেখতে হবে কোন কাজগুলো সব থেকে Important. যেটা Urgent and Important⇒ Focus on These. যেটা Non Urgent but Important⇒ Decide a time get it done. যেটা Urgent but not Important⇒ Find someone else or push back. যেটা Non Urgent and Non Important⇒ This becomes your “Do Not Do” list.
        
    - Personal Analysis(Do you self reflect?)
        
        নিজের সম্পর্কে চিন্তা করতে হবে। নিজেকে নিয়ে সময় দিতে হবে। নিজের ভুলগুলোকে বের করে সমাধান করতে হবে। নিজেকে সবসময় সবার সাথে Update রাখতে হবে।
        ⇒ আমি যখন একটা Company  তে চাকরি করতেছি তখন তারা আমাকে একটা Feedback দিল। আমি যদি এইটা মাথাই না রাখি, পরে দেখা যাবে আমি সেইম ভুল বারবার করতেছি। বিষয়টা মোটেও ভাল নয়। সুতরাং এগুলো মাথায় রাখতে হবে।
        
    - Personal Objectives(Discipline> motivation.)
        
        Goal ঠিক করতে হবে, ১ বছর বা ৫ বছর পর নিজেকে কোথায় দেখতে চান। নিজেকে সেই অনুযায়ী প্রস্তুত হতে হবে।

    ## ****Shihan Bai(Head of Engineering):****
    
    1. অনেক ক্ষেত্রে Payment Gateway Crashed করতে পারে Multiple Request একসাথে যাওয়ার জন্য। সে ক্ষেত্রে আমরা Back-end এ কিছু Queue ব্যবহার করতে পারি। প্রেমেন্টত Immediate হওয়ার দরকার নাই। আমরা এখানে যদি Backend এ Message Queue, Job Queue তৈরি করে দিতে পারি। সেক্ষেত্রে Queue থেকে request একটার পর একটা যেতে পারবে। আবার আমার একসাথে ১০০০ Email পাঠাতে হতে পারে, তখন ত একসাথে সবগুলো পাঠানোর দরকার নাই। আমি একটা Queue তে দিয়ে দিলাম Queue তখন একটার পর একটা পাঠাতে থাকল। Order তৈরি করার সময় ও আমারা Queue ব্যবহার করতে পারি। হাই লোড এ একটা Order তৈরি করতে ১ মিনিট ও সময় লাগতে পারে। সেজন্য আমরা এটাকে Offload/Queue(Redis, RabbitMQ)এর মাধ্যমে সমাধান করতে পারি। অর্থাৎ এই কাজগুলো এখন আমাদের করার দরকার নেই, আমরা একটা Queue এর মধ্যে দিয়ে দিব। Queue থেকে এইটা আস্তে আস্তে যেতে থাকবে বা তৈরি হতে থাকুক। কিন্তু আমার কাজটা Properly হোক।**[i]**
    2. মোট কথা আমরা Application Speed করতে গেলে আমাদেরকে Monitoring Tools Use করে বের করতে হবে Actual Problem টা কোথায় হচ্ছে, কোন জায়গায় আমাদের কাজ করতে হবে। Front-end হোক, Back-end হোক সব জায়গায় আমরা Modern Tools Use করে Code যতটুকু Optimize করা যায় করব। যত জায়গায় দরকার আমরা Caching করব, এইটা যদি Static Resource হয় এক ধরণের Caching করব, এইটা যদি Data হয় এক ধরণের Caching করব, এবং আমাদেরকে অনেক সময় Response Cache করে রাখতে হয় ওইটাও আমরা Cache করব। SEO আনার জন্য আমরা Server Side Rendering করব। পারলে সেটা কে Cache করব, না পারলে করব না। Nginx এর ক্ষেত্রে একটা Popular Strategy আছে এটাকে তারা বলে Micro Caching. এটা শুধু 1 Second এর জন্য একটা Response কে Cache করে। সুতরাং Caching টা খুব Important. **[p]**
    3. আরেকটা বিষয় দেখা যায় Front-end এ অনেক গুলো API Call করা হয় এই জন্য Application অনেক Slow হয়ে যায়। এইটা আমরা কিভাবে সমাধান করতে পারি? আমরা চাইলে যেই Data টা একটা আরেকটার সাথে Related ওইটাকে একটা API Call এর মধ্যে নিয়ে আসতে পারি। Backend অনেক সময় Unnecessary Information পাঠায় যেটা দরকার নেই ওইটা আমি নিব না। আরেকটা বিষয় Reloading, সবগুলো Data তো আমার একসাথে নামানোর দরকার নাই, আমার Page এর যেই অংশের জন্য দরকার আমি শুধু ওই অংশের জন্য Data নামাব, পরের অংশের জন্য Data লাগলে ওইটার টা পরে নামাব। এই ক্ষেত্রে আমরা GrapQL ব্যবহার করতে পারি Backend এ। Front-end এর সাথে Backend এর API Call কমানোর জন্য যে Strategy টা কাজ করে সেটা হল API Aggregation. **[q]**
    4. Backend এ কাজ করা অনেক কঠিন। কারণ Backend এ এক জায়গায় কাজ করলে দশ জায়গায় ভাঙ্গে, অনেক Safety Measurement নেওয়া লাগে। এই জন্য আমরা আমাদের Backend এর Code কে Unit Test করতে পারি। **[r]**
    5. Multiple Instance যখন করলাম, Multiple Database Cluster হল। এখন আমরা যখন Log গুলো দেখার চেস্টা করব এবং Debug করার চেস্টা করব তখন Log গুলোর Coordination খুজে পাব না। আগে একটা State ছিল তখন Debug করতে এত Problem হত না। এখনত Multiple State, এই সমস্যাটা কিভাবে সমাধান করতে পারি? এই ক্ষেত্রে অনেকগুলো VI Tools আছে যা আমরা ব্যবহার করতে পারি। এই Tools গুলো যেই কাজটা করে আসলে, অনেকগুলো Source থেকে Data এনে সেগুলোকে Aggregate করে নানান রকম Query করা যায়। **[s]**
    6. আমরা যখন Scaling করব তখন দুই ধরণের Scaling Tram আছে। একটা হল Vertical Scalability এবং আরেকটা হল Horizontal Scalability. Vertical Scalability মানে হচ্ছে আমার Server এ Ram কম ছিল CPU কম ছিল, আমি যতটুকু পারলাম বাড়িয়ে দিলাম। আর Horizontal Scalability মানে হচ্ছে আমার Multiple Server থাকবে, প্রতিটা আলাদা আলাদা Instance এ চলবে, একটা Cluster তৈরি করবে এবং এদের মধ্যে যেকোন একটা Request Handle করবে। এইখানে Load-balancing ও লাগবে। **[t]**
    
    ## ****Mozammel Bai(Head of Operation):****
    
    1. অনেক ক্ষেত্রে দেখা যায় Server Level এ কাজের মধ্যে একটা Instance ও আরেকটা Instance এর মধ্যে Network Problem হয়ে থাকে। তাহলে এক্ষেত্রে আমরা এইটা কিভাবে সমাধান করতে পারি? এই ক্ষেত্রে আমরা আমাদের Application Server গুলোকে Stateless করে ফেলতে পারি. Stateless করে ফেললে যেটা হবে আমরা Multiple Application Server Run করতে পারব। এছাড়া আমাদের Database এ যেহেতু Load বেশি হয় সেক্ষেত্রে আমাদের Database কে কিভাবে Scale করতে পারি এই বিষয়টাও দেখতে হবে। Application Server টাকে যখন আমরা Multiple Server করব তখন আমরা Containerization(Docker)করে ফেলতে পারি।**[k]**  
    2. Stateless Application বলতে বুঝায়, ধরি আমরা একটা Global Variable তৈরি করলাম। তারপর সেই Variable টা Multiple Function এর মাধ্যেমে Reference করলাম। এখন এই Application টা যদি আপনি দুইটা Instance এ চালান, আপনি যখন Variable সেট করবেন, তখন Variable সেট হবে কয়টাতে? অবশ্যই একটাতে হবে। আরেকটা Instance এ কিন্তু Set হবে না। ওইটা থেকে কিন্তু আপনি Variable টা Access করতে পারবেন না। Stateless Application গুলো যেটা করে, এগুলোর ভিতরে কোন State থাকে না, এই Concept টা Front-end এ খুবই Common. HTTP Modules হচ্ছে Stateless। Application Authenticate যখন করব প্রত্যেকবার আমাকে Cookies পাঠাতে হবে। State টাকে Maintain করতে হবে। **[L]**
    3. Backend কেও যখন আমরা Stateless করে ফেলব তখন Application Layer এ কোন Data থাকবে না। যদি Data লাগে থাহলে অন্য Instance থেকে Data নিতে হবে। এই ক্ষেত্রে আমাদের আলাদা একটা Service ব্যবহার করতে হবে, যেটার মধ্যে শুধু Data ই থাকবে,যেটা দ্রুত Memory থেকে Data Load করতে পারবে। এই রকম একটা Service হচ্ছে Redis. **[m]**
    4. ধরা যাক, আমি আমার Application Server ৪টা করে দিলাম। আমার Load এখন বেশি। আমি সামনে Load Balancer বসিয়ে দিলাম। Load Balancer কোন সময়, কোন Server কে Request পাঠাবে এইটা তার ব্যাপার। আমি যদি Application Server এর মধ্যে কোন State রাখি, সেটা পরের Request এর জন্য যখন Server এর কাছে যাবে সে তা পাবে না। তখন দেখা যাবে একটা Discrepancy তৈরি হবে। এই Problem কে Solve করার জন্য একটা Shared Data Storage রাখতে হবে। যেখানে আমরা Common data টা রাখব। অথবা Application এর State কে একটা নিদ্দিষ্ট জায়গায় রাখব। **[n]**
    5. Containerization Application নিয়ে কাজ করতে হলে Kubernetes Best Solution. আবার এটার পাশাপাশি Database Clustering করা প্রয়োজন। যেহেতু Database এ Load বেশি হচ্ছে, আমরা Application Handle করার জন্য যদি Kubernetes Use করি, Monitoring থেকে দেখা যাচ্ছে Database এ Load পড়তেছে থাহলে আমরা Database Slow Query গুলো দেখতে পারি অথবা Database Clustering করতে পারি। **[o]**
    
    ## **Anam Bai(Front-end):**
    
    **Front-end এ Improvement করা লাগবে কি না কিভাবে বুঝবঃ:**  
    
    1. Firstly Frontend Profiling করতে হবে। **[a]**
    2. Chromes lighthouse Report fixed For Front-end Speed. Google Chrome যা করতে বলছে/Recommendation যা দিছে আগে তা করতে হবে।**[b]**
    3. Resource Problem. Infrastructure এর কাছ থেকে যদি HTTP2 enable করে দেয় তাহলে ভাল।**[c]**
    4. Front-end Speed এর জন্য Tree Shaking করা লাগবে। এইখানে আমরা Modern Front-end Tools use করতে হবে। Reactive Framework uses করতে পারি, Modern Build Tools Use করে Proper Bundling Minimizing করতে পারি।যেখানে Automatically Tree Shaking করে দিবে। **[h]**
    
    ## ****Rabbil Bai(Back-end):****
    
    1. Backend e Sever Response speed করার জন্য Database Indexing করতে হবে। **[e]**
    2. যদি আমাদের Multiple Server এর মধ্যে কোন একটা Server Disconnect হয়ে যায় তখন কি করব? এইক্ষেত্রে CDN থাকার পাশাপাশি Original Callback থাকা উচিত। At least, Font-end Level এ যেহেতু এত load পড়তেছে, সেহেতু Load-Blanching ব্যবহার করা উচিত। Front-end Load-Balancing means ⇒ আমরা আমাদের Static Resource গুলোকে যদি Cloud এ নিয়ে যাইতে পারি, Cache করতে পারি অথবা Front-end কে একটা Single Page Application হিসেবে CDN এ দিয়ে দিতে পারি। অথবা আমরা আরেটা কাজ করতেপারি। PWA(Progressive Web Application) এ Service Worker ব্যবহার করে আমার Front-end এ যত JavaScript Chunk File আছে, CSS আছে আমরা চাইলে সবগুলো User এর Browser এ Cache করে User কে Offline Capability তৈরি করে দিতে পারি। এইক্ষেত্রে Front-end এর কারণে Server এ প্রেসারই আসবে না। শুধুমাত্র Server এ প্রেসার হবে Request আর Response এ.**[j]**
    
    ## ****Neyamot Bai(Infrastructure/Cloud):****
    
    1. HTTP2 Enable করার আগে আমাদের দেখতে হবে Server Level এ কোন Monitoring Tools ব্যবহার করছি কিনা। কিসের জন্য Server High হইয়ে যাচ্ছে সেটা দেখতে হবে। এইখানে কোন Memory Leak আছে কিনা, Ram Usage বেড়ে যাচ্ছে কিনা, নাকি Ram পাচ্ছে না বিধায় CPU বেড়ে যাচ্ছে, Reason টা কি সেটা দেখার জন্য আমরা Monitoring Tools(ZABBIX) ব্যবহার করতে পারি। **[d]**
    2. Backend API speed করার জন্য Caching করাটা জরুরি। আমাদের দেখা যাচ্ছে Single Server এর মধ্যে একসাথে সব কাজ হচ্ছে। সব কিছু আমরা Server থেকেই Load করতেছি। একটা Single Server এর মধ্যে Application, Database, সবকিছু একসাথে রাখতেছি। দেখা যাচ্ছে Database Query ও একসাথে Process হচ্ছে একই Server e এবং Image ও Download হচ্ছে একই Server থেকে। এইখানে আমরা CDN ব্যবহার করতে পারি। আমাদের Image গুলো Cache Server থেকে Load হবে। এইক্ষেত্রে Backend Server থেকে কিছু Load কমে যাবে। কোন Static Content Serve/Delivery করার জন্য Server কে কাজ Delay করতে হবে না। Content গুলো CDNথেকে Serve হবে। Single request আসবে Server এ, সেক্ষেত্রে Server এর Load একটু কমবে। **[f]**
    3. আরেকটা বিষয় দেখা যায় Image Frequently Change হয়।সেইক্ষেত্রে আমাদের কাজ হচ্ছে Cache Policy Defined করা। দেখা গেছে Image Server থেকে পাঠানো হইছে কিন্তু Cache Path ওইভাবে Mechanism করা হয়নি। সেইক্ষেত্রে Front-end এ দেখা যাবে Image Change হচ্ছে না। এইক্ষেত্রে CDN Use করার পাশাপাশি CDN Cache Policy, Past policy এগুলো Define করতে হবে। **[g]**
    4. কিছু কিছু Function কে আমরা Server-less করতে পারি। মানে এই Function গুলো একবার Run হবে তারপর Destroy হয়ে যাবে। এই ক্ষেত্রে আমাদের আগে Identify করা উচিত বা Predict করা উচিত কোন Function গুলো একটা Certain Time এর জন্য Run করবে। ওই Function গুলো কে আমরা Server-less করতে পারি। তাইলে আমাদের Cloud Cost কমে আসবে। অন্যথায় আমরা যদি সবগুলোকে Cloud এ নিয়ে যায় তা হলে Cloud Cost বেড়ে যাবে। আমরা জানি এই Function এর উপর প্রেসার পড়বে বা অন্য একটা সময় পড়বে, ওই সময়ের জন্য আমরা এইটাকে Server-less করতে পারি। **[w**]
